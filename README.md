# credit.card.validator
 Step 1 is to double every second digit, starting from the right. If it
         results in a two digit number, add both the digits to obtain a single
        digit number. Finally, sum all the answers to obtain 'doubleEvenSum'.   
 Step 2 is to add every odd placed digit from the right to the value
 'doubleEvenSum'.
 Step 3 is to check if the final 'doubleEvenSum' is a multiple of 10.
If yes, it is a valid CC number. Otherwise, not.

I have bank.account project in my matrix.x and I forgot to add validator
